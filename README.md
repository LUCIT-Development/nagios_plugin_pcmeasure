# Nagios Plugin for MessPC.de Ethernet Boxes

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mpibpc-mroose/nagios_plugin_pcmeasure.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mpibpc-mroose/nagios_plugin_pcmeasure)

An implementation for Perl already exists:
https://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Plugins/Hardware/Environmental/MessPC--2F-pcmeasure/details

... but is not maintained.

So I decided to implement it's functionality in Python.

There is no warranty for a 100% compatibilty to the old plugin, but
requests for adaptions and error reports are always welcome.
